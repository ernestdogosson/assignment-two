        <p>
          Hi there, &#128406 <br/>
          I am Ernest. I have just begun my front-end development journey at
          <span class="bold">Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola</span>, and I am excited to explore everything this
          path has to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love discovering how code can bring ideas to life and create
          websites that are both <span class="bold">functional and enjoyable</span> to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          What drives me is the mix of creativity and problem solving designing interfaces, experimenting with code, and learning new skills everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am looking forward to growing as a developer and building <span class="bold">projects
          that make a real impact</span>.
        </p>

              We covered what <span>HTML</span> is, which is a hyper markup language use to
              create the structure and render text unto a website. We also covered
              the basic structure of a web page and other elements and tags. below
              is list of some of the tags.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>DOCTYPE html</li>
              <li>html tag</li>
              <li>meta tag</li>
              <li>title</li>
              <li>header tag</li>
              <li>body</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We also covered some block elements and inline element tags. Examples
              of block tags are heading tags, div, img etc. while examples of inline
              tags elements are span, strong, em etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also installed some text editor, covered folder and file creation.
              installed some plugins to our editor to optimism workflow

            This was a bit challenging as a bit more technical topics were covered. We basically downloaded git and created a github account. We covered repository creation, how initialize file tracking, pull and add commits. We also saw to working in teams is facilitated through main and branch repos. Repository cloning was also covered and som commit best practices too. The main commands to keep in mind are:
              <ul>
                <li>git init at the start of every project</li>
                <li>git status to check status of files</li>
                <li>git add </li>
                <li>git commit</li>
                <li>git checkout</li>
                <li>git branch</li>
                <li>git merge</li>
              </ul> 
          </p>

          Starting this course has been both exciting and challenging. At first, I felt unsure about where to begin, even with basic HTML and CSS, but I quickly discovered how small changes could shape a webpage’s structure and style. Experimenting with images, colors, layouts, and simple effects taught me the basics of design and functionality, though I often ran into issues that required patience and trial-and-error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in these early stages, I have started to see how coding can be creative, and how learning step by step builds confidence. I am still exploring and figuring things out, but I feel motivated to continue, knowing that each small experiment brings me closer to understanding how websites really work.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Learning Git and GitHub was confusing at first. The concepts of commits branches, and pushing changes felt overwhelming, and I often got stuck trying to connect my local files to GitHub. Gradually, with practice, I started understanding how version control works and how to track changes properly. It is still new to me, but I am beginning to feel more confident navigating repositories and managing my projects online.
