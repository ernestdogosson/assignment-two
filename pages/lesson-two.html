          <h3>Lesson2</h3>
           <p>
            This was a bit challenging as a bit more technical topics were covered. We basically downloaded git and created a github account. We covered repository creation, how initialize file tracking, pull and add commits. We also saw to working in teams is facilitated through main and branch repos. Repository cloning was also covered and som commit best practices too. The main commands to keep in mind are:
              <ul>
                <li>git init at the start of every project</li>
                <li>git status to check status of files</li>
                <li>git add </li>
                <li>git commit</li>
                <li>git checkout</li>
                <li>git branch</li>
                <li>git merge</li>
              </ul>
